# UI Guidelines

This dashboard follows a vibrant, consistent design language focused on clarity and user delight.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles

- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Font Awesome icons for actions
- Tooltips for clarity and accessibility
- Empty states with illustrations and friendly messages
- Consistent spacing, padding, and visual hierarchy

## ðŸ“¦ Components

- `x-alert`: Feedback messages with icons
- `x-form-group`: Input wrapper with label and validation

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness

- Mobile-first layout using Bootstrap grid
- Tables collapse gracefully on smaller screens
- Forms stack vertically for readability
